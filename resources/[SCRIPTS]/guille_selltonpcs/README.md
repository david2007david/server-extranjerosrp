guille_selltonpcs

Description:

A FiveM release that allows you to sell drugs to the NPC. Also, you can be robbed by some NPC’s while selling drugs. The script includes an alert to the police.

It’s easy to use, and you can edit the drug that will be sold in the server side (intuitive). It has two languages, and you can select it in the config.

## Important information

The default robbery probability is 1/50, you can change this in the client side (commented line). The same with the police call (commented line). The resource needs ESX.

Thanks to NP for the function GetPedInFront(), optimized and cool.

Default: 0:01-0:02 ms

If you like the resource, preserve the original name in it to support me.
